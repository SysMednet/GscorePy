# GscorePy
**GscorePy** is a python implementation of Gscore.

**Gene Set Correlation Enrichment (Gscore)** is an online tool for interpreting and annotating gene expression dataset by using a dataset-derived coexpression network to measure the statistical significance of associations between your interesting differentially expressed gene (DEG) list (i.e., query) and the collection of gene sets. Based on the hypergeometric distribution with Benjamini–Hochberg correction, the tool identifies the coexpressed gene pairs between: 
  
**(1) individual DEG** in the query DEG list and all the DEGs of a certain gene set in the selected collection to determine its association significance;  
**(2) query DEG list** and all the DEGs of a certain gene set in the selected collection to determine its association significance.
